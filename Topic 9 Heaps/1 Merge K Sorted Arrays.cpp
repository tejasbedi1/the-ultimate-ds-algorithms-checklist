// MERGE K SORTED ARRAYS 
// Following solution best suited for similar sized arrays
// For differently sized arrays heap based solution is what we need

// TRY 1 
// Put everything in a array and Sort
// O(nk Lognk )

// TRY 2 
// KEEP MERGINING 2 at a time
// that will mean each merge 2n time with k/2 iterations So O(nk)
// With a total of log k iterations time complexity is 
// O( nk log k)

// TRY 3 
// HEAP BASED 
// PRESENT IN DIFFERENT FILE
