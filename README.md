# The Ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms Checklist

## What am I looking at here ?
This repository has a collection of Data Structures and Algorithm questions in the form of a Trello checklist meant for the toughest interviews. The checklist has links to resouces explaining the solutions.

## Who's it for ?
I intended this to be a resource for entry level developers, college undergrads practicing for technical interviews or for someone who just wants to brush up their DS Algo. 

## Do we really need this ?
With the presence of websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksForGeeks, Interview Bit, someone could argue its presence irrelevant. 

Well... I always found the curation on these websites somewhat off.
* Either the question lists they have aren't exaustive. So you would'nt know when to stop, or it just seems like a insermountable task completing all those Q's.
* Even if there exists an exhaustive list it would'nt be divided into further subtopics. Its like you can never be sure if you're covering all bases. 
* Sometimes the content is blocked behind a paywall.
* Other times you keep seeing questions repeating just in a different wrapper. 
* _Also, checklists are oh so much more satisfying._

## Navigating the Checklist
This would be the trello template I have been touting about: https://trello.com/b/iktOxew4

### Using TRELLO
To get started just Click on "Create Board from Template" on the trello link.

1. **Difficulty Labels** : I've added labels to the cards just as a general indication of the difficulty level per topic.

2. **Q & D's** : Questions in checklists sometimes have 'Q's and 'D's
* 'Q' indicates the index of the solution in my code folders.
* 'D' is an indication of the difficulty per card (out of 10). 'D' is only relevant per card and not relevant to the questions on the entire board. So D6 under "Trees" is not equivalent to D6 under "Graphs".

### Using The Code
I've written the solutions for some of the questions using C++. 
* My code sometimes would have explanations inside the main function if you'd like to read. 
* In any case answers could be referred from the resources provided.
* Some code files have standalone or accompanying images. Feel free to try and understand them xD.

## Why did I make this ?
I was'nt from a Tier 1 college. So although I loved to code, when placement season came around I wasn't exactly sure what to cover or focus on. So I had to settle for "not that great a job". When I started practicing for a better place, I needed an exastive list of problems, which gave me the most trust that I would be covering all bases. So I created this, using questions from GeeksForGeeks, LeetCode, Interview bit, Youtube and some lesser known places. The plan was always to complete it and make it available to all of you.

## FAQ's
### 1. Why a checklist ?
* Many people (me included) feel checklists are very powerful. Dividing a task in this form makes it easier to do. 
* Also, often when searching online for practice DS problems it often seems there are countless resources available and tons of info to go over. By making a checklist available there is an exhaustive list that you can focus on. 
* The nice dopamine hit by checking off topcis is also every addictive.

### 2. Do I need to code all answers ?
No, only code the answer only if you feel it presents a challenge/would improve your code writing skill/speed or maybe just help you to learn the topic better.

### 3. Do I go topic by topic ?
Again, No. Start with any topic you feel comfortable. I did however sort them in a manner I felt made sense and was consistent. However if questions in a topic get too difficult move on to different topic. **The trello checklist is meant to be completed in two passes**.

### 4. Does this have everything ?
Of course not. I tried to be thorough and will be updating this list from time to time. But its not possible to cover every question. But I'm sure completing this you'll be set to handle 99% of questions thrown at you.

### 5. I don't agree with your question choice...
By all means remove a question or edit away on your copy. These questions made the most sense according to me so I made it this way. you do you :)

### 6. There isn't a resource mentioned for some questions.
Although I added resources for most of them some problems you'll have to just Google. I assumed a basic understanding of the most common data structs.

### 7. Most problems here are pretty easy.
Are they? Wow you must be really good.

### 8. The repository's name is pretty cringy!
I know aakash thought so too, but it serves the purpose.
